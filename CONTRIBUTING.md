# Contribution Guidelines

## Contributing to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines.

- The pull request contains a fix a or new item rather than a duplicate of an existing one.
  (Go through the list carefully to verify that the item you're submitting is actually a new one.)
- The item you're submitting must be openly available and related to Digital Twins.
  The additions you specify should be genuinely useful to Digital Twin researchers and users.
  The objective of this list is utility rather than comprehensiveness.
- Ensure the provided link is a stable URL.
  The golden standard is a DOI, which you can e.g. easily obtain for data you upload on [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org/).
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Item Name](link) - Description`.
- Do not start the description with *A* or *An*.
- Maintain alphabetic ordering when adding items.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
